# Styleguide

The design reference for sinduri.lol: every visual rule, token and value.
Neo-brutalist, dark by default: heavy borders, hard offset shadows with zero
blur, uppercase headings, tilted marks.

- Tokens are defined in `@theme static` in `src/styles/global.css`. Where this
  file and the stylesheet disagree, the stylesheet is right.
- How tokens are enforced and how light mode is switched:
  [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md#design-system).
- The agent checklist, `.claude/skills/sinduri-design-system/SKILL.md`, links
  here.

## Tokens only

- Never an arbitrary value: no raw hex, no `text-[32px]`, no
  `shadow-[8px_8px_0]`. A missing value is a new token in `@theme`.
- Keep `static` on `@theme`: without it an unused token is tree-shaken and
  `var(--color-…)` resolves to nothing.
- `npm run check:tokens` fails on anything else:
  [Token enforcement](../ARCHITECTURE.md#token-enforcement).

## Principles

### The gold register

- `cyan` is what you are touching: hover and focus, never at rest.
- `pink` is depth and error: hard shadows, the bunny marks, the invalid edge.
- `border` is boundary. `text` is words.
- Gold is the single accent, held by a register rather than one job. A review
  checks the rendered page against the register, not a count. Do not "reduce
  gold to one job".
- **A gold use not on this list adds a row, with its argument, in the same
  change.**

| #   | Where gold is spent                                                                               | Measured on                            |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1a  | Ground, full slab: `/about`, `/career`, `/contact`, `/blog`, `/credits`                           | 5 routes                               |
| 1b  | Ground, thin slab: `/contact/sent`, both posts                                                    | 3 routes                               |
| 1c  | Ground, mid-page: a `Section surface="gold"`, the kindness quote                                  | `/career`, `/about`, `/`               |
| 2   | The primary action: `.nav-cta`, `.btn-primary`                                                    | 11 routes, 4 routes                    |
| 3   | The bunny marks: the logo tile and its copies, the roundel, the footer hare, the homepage sticker | 11 routes, 9 routes                    |
| 4   | Card labels, `.label text-gold`; a form's field labels are `text`                                 | `/about`, `/accessibility`, `/contact` |
| 4a  | A talk slide's label, bold words and part number, as the original deck set them                   | `/talks/<deck>/`                       |
| 5   | Category: the blog label and the homepage glyph tiles                                             | 3 routes                               |
| 6   | Display words: `Guntupalli`                                                                       | `/`                                    |
| 7   | List markers in `.bullet-list`                                                                    | wherever a bulleted list is            |

- A use with a replacement takes it: a `/career` date is `subtle`; the
  homepage stat numbers are `gold-text` on their gold band (gold on gold is
  1.00).

### The grid is visible where it is structural

- Drawn only where it carries content: the hero slab's 6/6 split, the four
  3-column spans of the `/accessibility` fact strip (divided by `border`
  rules), a post's reading column beside its contents rail.
- No cast-block wall.

### At most two light areas, and never two of a kind

- No two light areas in view at once as areas.
- No two of the same kind on one page: one gold band (a whole section) and
  one solid block (one card) may share a page; two bands or two blocks may
  not.
- Judged per screen, not per document: `/career` has a slab, a block and a
  band, and at 1280 by 900 no two share a screen as areas.

### Where brutalism and accessibility pull apart

| Tension                             | Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heavy uppercase, tight tracking     | Uppercase on headings, labels and buttons only. Negative tracking only at 26px and up (h1, h2); labels +0.1em. A heading word over 12 characters takes a soft hyphen.                           |
| Loud accents against 4.5:1          | `pink` `#FF007A` never sets text. `pink-text` `#FF79B6` carries every pink glyph ([Contrast](#contrast)).                                                                                       |
| Hard shadow looks like a focus ring | The ring is cyan, which appears only on interaction, offset past the element's shadow by `--lift`, so it only touches ground (11.20).                                                           |
| Error signalled by colour           | `pink` against `border` is 1.01. An error is a shape change (a 4px pink inset ring inside the pink 8px edge), a ✕ mark and words.                                                               |
| Tilt hurts reading                  | Tilt only marks (tile, roundel, stickers), at 3deg. Text and headings never rotate; a sticker's label of one to three words turns with it (close row eyebrow, post tags; `tests/tilt.spec.ts`). |
| Greyed-out disabled fails SC 1.4.11 | Dashed edge, no shadow. Label stays 8.62; control stays focusable (`aria-disabled`).                                                                                                            |
| Density against 320px reflow        | Spacing tokens are fluid; every 8px border is counted in the 288px content box before any heading floor changes.                                                                                |

## Colour tokens

| Token        | Hex       | Job                                |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `background` | `#131313` | Page ground; header, footer, bands |
| `surface`    | `#1A1A1A` | Cards, inputs                      |
| `border`     | `#5A87A8` | Every boundary                     |
| `text`       | `#E5E2E1` | Words                              |
| `subtle`     | `#9BB4C6` | Captions, meta, helper text        |
| `gold`       | `#FFC000` | The accent, per the register       |
| `cyan`       | `#00DCFD` | Hover and focus only               |
| `pink`       | `#FF007A` | Depth and error; never text        |
| `pink-text`  | `#FF79B6` | Every pink glyph; never non-text   |
| `bunny`      | `#FF007A` | Bunny marks; same in both modes    |
| `tile-edge`  | `#5A87A8` | Logo tile copies' edge; both modes |

The gold-ground set is in [Gold surface](#gold-surface), light values in
[Light mode](#light-mode).

- Two dark grounds: `background` (page, header, footer, bands) and `surface`
  (cards, inputs). Measure every foreground against both.
- `text` for words, `subtle` for captions and meta. Links are `text`, cyan on
  hover; in running text underlined at 2px, 4px on hover.
- `cyan` never at rest: a cyan label, fill or shadow reads as a control under
  the pointer.
- `pink` never sets text, at any size. `pink-text` never sets a border, shadow
  or fill. Do not merge them. Utilities: `bg-pink`, `border-pink`,
  `text-pink-text`.
- `border` is the SC 1.4.11 floor and `subtle` is set by contrast:
  re-measure before changing either.
- "Where you are" is a shape, not a colour: see [Navigation](#states).
- Never signal state by colour alone (SC 1.4.1).

### Adding a colour

1. Add it as a token in `@theme`.
2. Measure it on `#131313` and `#1A1A1A`, on `#FFC000` if it can appear on
   gold, and its light value on `#ffffff`.
3. Meet 4.5:1 for text (7:1 where achievable), 3:1 for large text, borders,
   focus rings and icons.
4. Add it to the table above and run `node scripts/contrast-table.mjs --write`.
   A token that can sit on gold also goes in the checked gold tables
   ([Gold surface](#gold-surface)).

## Contrast

Every approved pairing, measured from the live tokens. Text needs 4.5 (SC
1.4.3); large text and non-text need 3.0 (SC 1.4.11). Text targets 7:1 (SC
1.4.6) where achievable. "Kept apart" rows must never touch.

## Gold surface

`#FFC000` as a ground: the grounds in [the gold register](#the-gold-register),
rows 1a to 1c. L(`#FFC000`) is 0.5896, so AAA needs a foreground luminance of
0.0414 or less: only near-blacks read on it. Every dark token (`border`,
`text`, `subtle`, `pink-text`, `pink`, `cyan`) fails on gold. Use the inverted
set; hex values and ratios are in the generated [Contrast](#contrast) table:

| Token            | Job                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gold-text`      | Body copy, headings, button borders, the focus ring     |
| `gold-muted`     | Secondary copy                                          |
| `gold-border`    | Structural rules, dividers, card edges and shadows      |
| `gold-link`      | Links, underlined; the block on hover                   |
| `gold-bud`       | The canvas buds on gold. Decoration                     |
| `gold-btn-label` | Label and inner ring on `.btn-gold-primary`'s fill only |

- Build gold with `.surface-gold`, never `bg-gold` by hand. It repaints text,
  `.lead`, `.panel-lead` and `.standfirst` (`gold-text`), links (`gold-link`,
  underlined), the focus ring (`gold-text`) and default borders
  (`gold-border`). A card inside turns transparent with
  `shadow-hard-gold-border-8`; a linked chip keeps its dark fill with a
  `gold-text` edge.
- A whole gold section (hero slab, gold band) is also a `.gold-column`.
- Keep the link underline: `gold-link` is 1.01 against `gold-text`, so the
  underline carries SC 1.4.1.
- `gold-btn-label` sits only on `.btn-gold-primary`'s `#131313` fill (18.58),
  never on gold.
- No `gold-subtle`: a third step would be indistinguishable from `gold-text`.
  Below `gold-muted`, hierarchy is weight and size.
- No `cyan`, `pink` or `pink-text` on gold, not even a shadow, except the pink
  shadow on buttons, chips and photos, which is decoration and never delimits
  a control. A `.sticker` carries its own dark ground.
- A utility written inside a gold section (`border-border`, `text-subtle`)
  beats the subtree default and is a bug. axe misses it;
  `tests/gold-surface.spec.ts` catches it.
- No single line of text crosses the gold's edge: nothing clears 4.5 on both
  grounds. The homepage name breaks on the rule, `text` above and `gold-text`
  below; `tests/hero-fit.spec.ts` keeps it two lines.

### Buttons on gold

- Never `.btn-primary` (a 1.00 fill on gold) or `.btn-secondary` (`border`
  2.34, pink shadow 2.31).
- `.btn-gold-primary`: `gold-text` fill, `gold-btn-label` label, 4px
  `gold-text` border, `shadow-hard-bunny-4`, the two-tone ring
  ([Focus](#focus)).
- `.btn-gold-secondary`: transparent, `gold-text` label and 4px border, no
  shadow, single ring.
- Borders are `gold-text`, matching the fill, not `gold-border`;
  `tests/gold-surface.spec.ts` asserts it.
- Both are scoped to `.surface-gold` and render unstyled elsewhere.
- Both `text-button`, 900, 0.1em, uppercase, `px-8 py-4`. No underline on the
  label.

## Light mode

The switch and what it scopes: [ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md#light-mode).

| Token                                               | Light     | on `#ffffff` |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| `background`, `surface`, `hero-ground`              | `#ffffff` | ground       |
| `text`, `border`, `pink`, `gold-border`, `gold-bud` | `#131313` | 18.58        |
| gold as text, `.text-gold`                          | `#131313` | 18.58        |
| `subtle`                                            | `#3f4650` | 9.53         |
| `pink-text`                                         | `#b00054` | 7.06         |
| `cyan` (focus ring, hover fill under white)         | `#008194` | 4.60         |

- Every hard shadow and edge turns `#131313`.
- `.surface-gold` and `.v-column` go white. Buttons, tiles and stickers keep
  their `#FFC000` fill, always under `#131313` (11.32).
- Gold text turns ink; a `.label.text-gold` and a slide label gain a gold
  square before the word.
- Bunny marks use `bunny`, `tile-edge` and `shadow-hard-bunny-*`, never
  `pink` or `border`: they do not change with the mode.
- The label on a gold fill is `gold-text`, never `background` (white in
  light).
- RIDET and `.sticker` are black blocks.
- `tests/light-mode.spec.ts` scans every route in light at WCAG 2.2 AA.

## Type scale

Lexend Variable, weights 400 and 900 only. Sizes are `clamp()` tokens; the
copyright and contents list are fixed, and `text-code` is a ratio.

- Lexend, self-hosted from `@fontsource-variable/lexend` (OFL-1.1), family
  `'Lexend Variable'`. Only the latin subset is declared, in the `@font-face`
  at the top of `global.css`: importing the package CSS ships all three
  subsets. Never the Google Fonts CDN.
- `--font-mono` is the platform monospace stack, nothing downloaded.
- 400 for reading text; 900 for headings, card titles, labels, buttons, names
  and quoted text. Never 300 or `font-bold`.
- Every size is a token. No breakpoint steps.
- Nothing renders under 16px on a phone: `text-label` and `text-button` are
  16px to 40rem (`tests/text-size.spec.ts`).
- Headings never skip levels; one `<h1>` per page.
- `text-hero-h1` floors at 28px so the homepage name stays two lines.
- `text-reading-h1` is for the Privacy and Accessibility titles only. It
  shares `text-h1`'s 33px floor and `9vw` term: change both together.
- Posts use `text-post-*`. Do not raise them to the page scale.
- The footer name's 32px floor keeps "Lepus Ridet" on one line at 288px.
- Tracking: `--tracking-heading` -0.05em on h1 and h2, `--tracking-title`
  -0.02em on h3, post and slide titles and the footer name, `--tracking-label`
  0.1em on labels and buttons.
- The standfirst is `max-w-2xl`, `--spacing` step 8 under the title.

### Heading floors

Set by reflow, not taste. `.page-gutter` leaves a 273px content box at 305px
(400% zoom) and 288px at 320px. `tests/reflow.spec.ts` holds them; rerun it
before raising one.

- `text-h1` 33px: `PROFESSIONAL` and `ACCESSIBILITY` fit 273px; 34px leaves
  `ACCESSIBILITY` 2px of room.
- `text-h2` 26px, `text-h3` 20px. Do not raise h2 to 29px or h3 to 24px:
  26:24 reads as one size at 320px. Do not even out the h1:h2 ratio by
  raising h2.
- `ANNOUNCEMENTS` needs 29px and is not fitted.
- Never zero the gutter below `sm`; move the floors instead.
- Headings set `hyphens: auto` and `overflow-wrap: break-word`. Never
  `hyphens: none` on a heading.

### Uppercase

- Write sentence case. `.label`, `.badge`, the buttons and every heading apply
  `text-transform: uppercase`. A post title and a talk slide title keep their
  written case (`.post-title`, `.slide-title`).
- Chromium exposes the uppercased string in the accessible name (`About`
  becomes `"ABOUT"`); Firefox and WebKit do not. Sentence case is the one
  input correct under both, and keeps copy, search and previews in real case.
- How a screen reader announces caps is untested
  ([MANUAL_TESTING.md](MANUAL_TESTING.md) §6). Do not claim caps are spelled
  out letter by letter.

### Soft hyphens

- A word over twelve characters in an `h1` or `h2` takes a soft hyphen
  (U+00AD) at a syllable boundary. Chromium's hyphenation dictionary misses
  uppercased words; a soft hyphen survives `text-transform`.
- Width, not count, is the real test: measure against 273px at 33px
  (`WOODWORKING`, eleven letters, overflows).

| Path                                     | Write                         |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `.astro` template text                   | `<h1>Acces&shy;sibility</h1>` |
| Markdown body heading                    | `## Announce&shy;ments`       |
| Frontmatter, or any interpolated `{...}` | the literal U+00AD character  |

Interpolated `&shy;` is escaped and renders as `&SHY;`. Mark a literal U+00AD
with a comment beside it.

## Spacing scale

- Base unit 4px. Allowed Tailwind steps: **0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24**
  (4 to 96px).
- Banned: half steps (0.5, 2.5, 3.5), odd steps (5, 7), and 10, 14, 20, 28.
- `scripts/check-tokens.mjs` fails on any other step in a margin, padding, gap
  or inset utility.

| Token                                     | Value                                          | 390px  | 1200px and up |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| `--spacing-section`                       | section to section                             | 56     | 96            |
| `--spacing-head`                          | heading or lead to content; content to actions | 32     | 48            |
| step 6                                    | heading to lead                                | 24     | 24            |
| `--spacing-grid`                          | card to card                                   | 28     | 40            |
| `--spacing-inline`; step 6                | inline controls; chips                         | 16; 24 | 24; 24        |
| `--spacing-card-tight` / `--spacing-card` | card padding                                   | 24     | 40 from 640px |

### Gutter and column

- The gutter is `.page-gutter` (`px-4 sm:px-6`) on the header, `<main>` and
  `<footer>` only. Never add or remove horizontal padding on a page
  container: it breaks the 273px box the heading floors are calibrated to.
- `.band` breaks out of the gutter with negative margins that duplicate
  `.page-gutter`'s four values; change them together.
- The column is `max-w-page` (80rem) on the element inside the gutter, never
  the gutter inside the column: it drifts by one gutter above 80rem.
- Decorations position against the layout they sit in, never the viewport.
  On small screens move a decoration rather than deleting it.

### The roundel's size

- `--spacing-roundel` is `2 × --spacing-section − 56px`: 56px on a phone,
  128px from about 1150px.
- Derived so the disc keeps at least 24px to the hero's last line and 32px to
  the next content; it is lifted `--spacing(1)` above the edge to split the
  space 24 and 32.
- Rejected: a fixed 96px disc (8px to the title on a phone), a jump to 128px at
  `lg` (18px each side at 1024px), a 64 to 96px clamp (24px below on a phone).
- `--spacing-roundel-mark` is half the disc.
- `tests/page-hero.spec.ts` measures both gaps at 320, 390, 640, 768, 900,
  1023, 1024 and 1280px, and at 200% zoom.

## Borders, shadows and radius

- Border widths 0, 4 or 8. 8px: cards, panels, form fields, gold areas, the
  header's bottom edge, the `/accessibility` fact-strip rules, a prose `hr`.
  4px: photos, chips, buttons, stickers, code blocks. No rule between
  sections.
- The default border colour is `border`, set in the base layer (Tailwind 4
  defaults to `currentColor`); `gold-border` inside `.surface-gold`.
- Shadows are hard offsets, no blur. Gold casts none (gold on gold is 1.00).

| Utility                     | Casts it                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shadow-hard-pink-4`        | `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, link chips, `.nav-cta`, the theme switch, footer stickers, slide cards |
| `shadow-hard-pink-8`        | Cards, card groups, post contents, gold areas, the PageHero photo                                        |
| `shadow-hard-cyan-8`        | A hovered linked card or contact card, in place of pink                                                  |
| `shadow-hard-gold-border-8` | A card on gold                                                                                           |
| `shadow-hard-bunny-4`       | `.sticker`, `.btn-gold-primary`                                                                          |
| `shadow-hard-bunny-8`       | The logo tile, the roundel, the homepage stickers                                                        |
| `shadow-hard-bunny-12`      | The logo tile's larger copy on `/about`                                                                  |

- `bunny` is `pink`'s hex but stays pink in light mode, where `pink` turns
  ink.
- Anything focusable with a shadow sets its lift: [Focus](#focus).
- Radius is 0 everywhere (base layer). `rounded-nav` (14px): the logo tile and
  its copies (`Header.astro`, the Lepus Ridet panel on `/about`). `rounded-full`: the roundel and the Star Trek thumbnail on
  `/about`. No pills; any other rounded corner is a bug.

## Components

Component classes live in `@layer components` in `src/styles/components/`, one
file per area.

| Class                                   | What                                                                                                 |

| `.chip`                                 | Tags, jump links, filters, pager. Always a link. `border-4`, 24px target; a chip list is `gap-6`     |
| `.badge`                                | A non-link fact or state. Flat `bg-text`, `background` label, no border or shadow                    |

### Control states

- Hover: `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary` and `.nav-cta` fill cyan with a
  `background` label (11.20).
- Pressed: buttons, `.nav-cta`, `.btn-gold-primary`, linked chips and footer
  stickers drop their shadow and move 4px into it; the logo tile 8px. No move
  under reduced motion. `tests/press.spec.ts` presses each.
- Unavailable: `aria-disabled="true"`, never `disabled`. Dashed border,
  `bg-background`, `subtle` label, no shadow; still focusable.
- Sending: the contact submit is `aria-disabled` in a `data-sending` form but
  drawn pressed and gold, not unavailable (`src/scripts/contact-sending.ts`).
- Current: [Navigation states](#states).

### Markup

- Native elements before ARIA: a modal is `<dialog>` + `showModal()`, a
  disclosure `<details>`/`<summary>`, a click target `<button type="button">`,
  navigation `<a href>`, grouped fields `<fieldset>`/`<legend>`. No
  focus-trap libraries.
- ARIA, alt text and text over photographs:
  [ACCESSIBILITY.md §9](../ACCESSIBILITY.md#9-contributor-checklist).
- Photos: a 4px `border` frame, no shadow or tilt, except the PageHero photo
  (8px pink shadow).
- `.card-solid`: only `background` passes on its `text` fill (14.42), so
  everything inside is `background`, the focus ring included. Text only, never
  a form. Focusable content sits at least 8px inside.
  `tests/solid-block.spec.ts`.
- Breadcrumbs stop at the parent; JSON-LD `BreadcrumbList` adds the page
  (`tests/breadcrumbs.spec.ts`).

## Sections, rhythm and grid

The grid rule in `scripts/check-tokens.mjs` enforces the grid;
`tests/headings.spec.ts` holds section headings to one size.

### Section types

| Type    | Build                                                                                                                      |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hero    | First section on every page except a post; a `.gold-column`. See [Hero](#hero).                                            |
| Open    | `Section`: `text-h2` heading, optional `.lead` 24px under it, content at `--spacing-head`, `max-w-page` in `.page-gutter`. |
| Panel   | `Section panel`: the same box, the whole section in one `.card`, its h2 `text-h2` inside the card.                         |
| Listing | Grid of cards, 1 to 3 columns, `--spacing-grid` gaps: blog index, categories, tags, Home's two grids.                      |
| Reading | One `.prose` column, `max-w-measure` (36rem): Privacy, Accessibility, a post's body.                                       |
| Surface | The gold band (Home, Career, Contact), a `.gold-column`. With the hero slab, the only change of ground.                    |
| Close   | `CloseRow`, its own band, always last, never nested.                                                                       |

### One treatment per type

`tests/section-types.spec.ts` compares instances across pages.

- **Text section** (heading and short paragraphs): a panel, heading inside at
  `text-h2`, including "Summary" on `/career` and the message on
  `/contact/sent`.
- **Panel heading:** `text-h2` on every page. A page with panels opens on the
  full slab.
- **Cross-links between two sections:** a chip.
- **The kindness sentence:** `text-h2` at 900, on `/about` and on `/contact`'s
  closing band.
- **A name with a line saying what it did** (`/credits`): each entry on an
  inset `bg-background` tile inside the card. No rule between entries.
- **Photo captions:** none on People and places; the alt text names who is in
  each photo. Where a photo carries a caption, it sits on an inset tile.
- **Form fields:** an 8px edge. A failing field adds a 4px pink inset ring
  inside the pink 8px edge.

### How sections separate

- Everything after the hero is a `Section`, one `--spacing-section` from the
  next.
- A gold band's padding is inside its own ground, so the section after it
  keeps its own top: two `--spacing-section` across that join. `CloseRow` is
  `py-section`, not `pb-section`, for this reason.
- The slab's edge separates the hero from the first section; no line under it.
- The only ground change is gold (hero slab and gold surface), 11.32 against
  the page, never colour alone.
- Panels and the closing row are cards: 8px border and shadow.
- No rules or dividers between sections or before the footer.

### Section headers

- `<section aria-labelledby="{id}-heading">` with `<h2 id="{id}-heading">`.
- Heading: `text-h2`, 900, uppercase, `--tracking-heading`, `text` (14.42). No
  eyebrow label; labels belong to cards.
- Lead: `.lead`, `text-h3` at 400, 24px under the heading.
- Content: `--spacing-head` under the heading or lead.
- `Section headless` when the heading sits beside a picture: the slot renders
  the `h2` with id `<id>-heading`. No rule above a heading.

### First and last

- First: the hero, owning the page's h1. A post opens on its article header.
- Last: `CloseRow` on pages that end on links (`/`, `/about`, `/career`,
  `/contact/sent`); otherwise the last section's bottom padding. The footer
  follows with no separator.

### Grid

- **Below 640px:** one column; 16px gutter.
- **640 to 1023px:** listings in two columns; splits stack; 24px gutter.
- **1024px and up:** listings up to three columns; splits on one 12-column
  grid with `--spacing-grid` gaps: 7/5, 6/6, 5/7 or 3/9.
- **May break the grid, and nothing else:** the hero slab and gold surface
  (right edge reaches toward the screen), a photo strip (scrolls sideways in
  its card as a focusable region), a tilted mark's corners and any hard shadow
  (up to 12px past the column).
- **Reflow:** every type is one column below 640px, on the 288px content box
  at 320px. At 200% zoom a 1280px window is 640 CSS px. Only the photo strip
  and wide tables scroll sideways, each in its own region.

### Page compositions

| Page                      | Order (type)                                                   |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Home                      | Hero, Surface, Listing, Listing, Close                         |
| About                     | Hero, Open, Open, Open, Open, Open, Close                      |
| Career                    | Hero, Panel, Open (with the solid block), Open, Surface, Close |
| Contact                   | Hero, Open, Surface                                            |
| Contact sent              | Hero, Panel, Close                                             |
| Credits                   | Hero, Open (panels), Open (panels)                             |
| Privacy, Accessibility    | Hero (reading measure), Reading                                |
| Blog index, category, tag | Hero, Listing                                                  |
| Post                      | Article header, Reading (contents box from 1280px), Tags nav   |
| 404                       | Hero (starfield) only                                          |

- Contact ends on its gold surface, not a closing row: the band is its call to
  action.
- The blog listing has no section heading: each card's title is its h2.

## Hero

`src/components/PageHero.astro`. Enforced by `tests/page-hero.spec.ts` and
`tests/gold-surface.spec.ts`.

Four openings, no fifth: Home's canvas hero, a talk's cover slide, a post's
`.post-slab`, and `PageHero` everywhere else.

### The slab tiers

Set by `PageHero`'s `slab` prop. The tier follows what is under the title, not
how important the page is.

| Tier  | `slab`   | Routes                                                                                  | Ground   | Title                                                       | Aside              | Padding              |
| ----- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Full  | `"full"` | `/about`, `/career`, `/contact`, `/blog`, `/credits`; `/contact/send`, `/blog/page/<n>` | gold     | `text-h1`; `text-h2` on the last two                        | `.standfirst`      | `py-section`         |
| Thin  | `"thin"` | `/contact/sent`, and a post's own `.post-slab`                                          | gold     | `text-post-title`                                           | `text-post-teaser` | `pt-head pb-section` |
| Plain | `"none"` | `/privacy`, `/accessibility`, category and tag listings, `/404`                         | the page | `text-reading-h1`; `text-h2` on categories, tags and `/404` | `text-post-teaser` | `pt-head pb-section` |

- **Full:** the opening is a statement and the other half of the composition
  has content.
- **Thin:** one short line and no section headings after it. A 52px thin title
  under 64px panel headings would be outranked, so a page with panels is never
  thin. `/blog` is not thin: its featured title is `text-post-card-feature` at
  64px.
- **Plain:** a document, or a page whose chips and cards say what it is. Takes
  `.reading-layout` in the same change, which sets `.prose h2` to
  `text-post-h2` (title to first heading 1.94:1, against 1.09:1 at `text-h2`).
- The plain tier is a dark slab in the gold column's shape holding the title
  and roundel; the breadcrumb sits above it and everything else under it, on
  the page body's column (the measure on a reading page, the page column on a
  listing).
- `/404` sets `starfield`: stars across the whole slab on an `aria-hidden`
  layer; `.star-clear` puts the slab's ground behind the kicker and title, so
  no star shows behind text. `tests/not-found.spec.ts` checks it.

### Variants

| Variant  | Where                                                                | Title                            | Column                             |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Home     | `/` only                                                             | its own hero, `HeroField.vue`    | its own composition                |
| Standard | About, Career, Contact, Blog, Credits                                | `text-h1`                        | `max-w-page`; 6 of 12 with a photo |
| Reading  | Privacy, Accessibility (`measure="reading"`)                         | `text-reading-h1`                | `max-w-measure`, the prose column  |
| Compact  | category and tag listings, `/contact/send`, `/blog/page/<n>`, `/404` | `text-h2`, still the page's `h1` | `max-w-page`                       |
| Thin     | `/contact/sent`                                                      | `text-post-title`                | `max-w-page`                       |

A post opens on its article header, not PageHero, but its slab is the thin
tier and takes its padding.

### Semantics

- One `<section class="page-hero">`, first child of `<main>`, holding the only
  `h1`.
- Breadcrumbs go in the `eyebrow` slot above the `h1`, as a named `nav`,
  with `tone="gold"` on a slab.
- The photo is a `<figure>`; its credit, if any, a `figcaption`.
- The roundel is decoration: `alt=""`, no role, no focus.

### Layout

- Shape: `.gold-column`. Left edge on the page column; right edge reaches past
  it until the pink shadow is 48px from the screen edge, never short of the
  page column. Below 40rem it sits in the page gutter.
- Edge: one 8px `border` and the 8px pink shadow, as a card. Text inset by
  `--hero-column-pad-inline`.
- PageHero and `.post-slab` stand `--hero-pad-block` below the header.
- With a photo, from 1024px: text on 6 of 12 columns, centred; photo on
  columns 8 to 12, 4:5, on the slab's bottom. Below that the photo follows the
  text at `max-w-sm`, 48px under it.
- The photo hangs `--spacing-head` past the slab's bottom edge, and the hero
  keeps `--spacing-head` below it so the next section clears the photo.
- On a landscape window from 1024px the slab fills the window less the
  overhang, so the photo's shadow ends on the fold.
- No line, fill, card or separator strip between the hero and the first
  section.
- Two `--spacing-section` (112 to 192px) between the hero's last line and the
  next content. In forced colours the slab paints Canvas and drops shadows,
  so this gap and the `h1` set the hero apart. `tests/page-hero.spec.ts`
  measures it in forced colours at 320px and 200% zoom.

### The roundel rule

**Every hero carries exactly one mark: the photo if it has one, otherwise the
roundel.**

- `PageHero` renders the roundel whenever it has no `image`. There is no prop.
- About is the one hero with a photo, so the one without a roundel.
- The homepage is not a PageHero and has no roundel on its window.
- `variant="hero"`: a gold disc of `--spacing-roundel` with a `gold-text` ring
  (4px, 8px from `lg`), pink 8px shadow, 3deg tilt.
- Its centre sits `--spacing(1)` above the slab's bottom edge; its right side
  on the column's text edge (`.hero-roundel`).
- On a plain tier it straddles the dark slab's bottom edge too, and is never
  left off. The slab's bottom padding is half the disc plus 24px; the text
  under it starts 32px past the disc's lower half.
- The disc sets a slab's minimum bottom padding: half the disc plus its lift
  plus 24px, 92px at 1280. Only `--spacing-section` clears it, so a thin slab
  is thin at the top only.
- `tests/page-hero.spec.ts` checks `.page-hero` and `.post-slab` at 1280 and
  390px: roundel present, on the edge, ringed `gold-text`, over no text; absent
  on `PHOTO_ROUTES`. A new hero photo adds its route there.

### Colour roles and ratios

| What                        | Colour on ground                | Ratio | Needs      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Title, standfirst, body     | `gold-text` on gold             | 11.32 | 4.5        |
| Breadcrumb separators       | `gold-muted` on gold            | 7.88  | 4.5        |
| Links (breadcrumbs, mailto) | `gold-link` on gold, underlined | 11.38 | 4.5        |
| Chip fill against the slab  | `surface` on gold               | 10.60 | 3          |
| Chip label                  | `text` on `surface`             | 13.51 | 4.5        |
| Focus ring                  | `gold-text` on gold             | 11.32 | 3          |
| Photo border                | `gold-text` on gold             | 11.32 | decoration |
| Roundel ring on the slab    | `gold-text` on gold             | 11.32 | decoration |
| Roundel disc off the slab   | gold on `background`            | 11.32 | decoration |
| Photo and chip shadows      | pink on gold                    | 2.31  | decoration |

- Pink never delimits anything on the slab: every control has its fill or a
  `gold-text` border.
- The page's own colours fail here: `subtle` 1.31, `border` 2.34, the page
  link colour 1.00.

### Calls to action

- Gold buttons only: [Buttons on gold](#buttons-on-gold).
- Career is the one hero with actions: the CV download, then Get in touch,
  `--spacing-head` under the standfirst.
- Career is also the one hero with a line of fact: `mt-4 text-body
text-gold-muted` under the standfirst, not a fourth `.block` beat. Colour
  and size both differ, because forced colours flattens the colour.

### Media

- Portrait photo: `aspect-portrait` (4:5), `object-cover`, 4px `gold-text`
  border, pink 8px shadow.
- Eager, `fetchpriority="high"`: it is the largest paint.
- A failed load keeps the 4:5 frame and shows its alt text; see
  [Photo frames and the failed-photo state](#photo-frames-and-the-failed-photo-state).
- Never text over a photo.

### Header relation

- The header is opaque `background` with an 8px `border` bottom edge.
- The logo tile and the slab share the gold ground and dark type; the tile
  keeps its pink shadow.
- The sticky header covers the top of the slab on scroll; nothing on the slab
  is fixed.

### Hero motion

None. Gold buttons press 4px into their shadow at 0ms like every control. The
roundel's tilt is static.

## Posts

Enforced by `tests/post-page.spec.ts`.

### Structure

- One `<article>`: `section.post-slab` (thin gold opening), then
  `.band.py-section` holding `.post-layout`. `BaseLayout` adds no
  element, so articles never nest.
- Source order: the `<header>` in the slab (breadcrumb, `h1`, teaser, date and
  reading time), contents list, `.prose`, tags.
- Below `xl` they stack at `--spacing-head`; from `xl` the contents list sits
  right of the text, capped at `--container-rail`.
- Outline: one `h1`; `h2` per section; `h3` only under an `h2`. The contents
  list and tags carry labels, not headings.

### Measure

- `--container-measure`, 36rem (576px), for the post, its opening, contents
  and tags, and for Privacy and Accessibility. At most 75 characters per line
  at the 18px body floor.
- In rem, not `ch`: Firefox measures Lexend's `ch` wider than Chromium.
- `text-reading-h1` stops at 70px so ACCESSIBILITY fits one line; never 64px
  or less (`text-h2`'s ceiling).
- Post photo `sizes`: `min(calc(100vw - 3rem), 36rem)` from 640px,
  `min(calc(100vw - 2rem), 36rem)` below.

### The opening

| Relationship              | Value         | Same as                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Breadcrumb to title       | `mb-6` (24px) | every breadcrumb             |
| Title to teaser           | `mt-6` (24px) | a post card, title to teaser |
| Teaser to date            | `mt-8` (32px) | a post card, teaser to date  |
| A label to what it labels | `mt-4` (16px) | a card's label to its title  |

### Rhythm inside `.prose`

| Element     | Treatment                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Paragraph   | `mt-6`, `text-body` (18 to 19px, line height 1.62), `text`                                                   |
| `h2`        | `mt-16`, `text-post-h2` (24 to 36px); its text follows at the next `mt-6`                                    |
| `h3`        | `mt-12`, `text-post-h3` (19 to 24px). The last level                                                         |
| Inline code | `.prose code`: the mono stack at `--text-code`, on a `surface` fill with `px-1` and no border                |
| Code block  | `.prose pre`: mono, `border-4 border-border` on `surface`, `p-4`, scrolls sideways, a named tab stop         |
| Lists       | `mt-6 pl-6`, items `mt-3`, gold markers; a link-only item is 24px tall                                       |
| Blockquote  | `mt-6`, `border-l-8 border-gold`, `pl-6`, its text at weight 900                                             |

| Figure      | `mt-8`, an `.aspect-frame` sized by the file with a 4px `border` ring; caption `mt-4 text-label text-subtle` |

- A heading sits 24px above its own text and 48 to 64px below the text before
  it.
- Nested lists have no styles; no post uses them.

#### Syntax highlighting is off

- Shiki writes inline `style` attributes; `public/_headers` sets `style-src`
  without `'unsafe-inline'`, so the browser blocks them.
- `astro.config.mjs` sets `syntaxHighlight: false`; `tests/code-block.spec.ts`
  asserts the setting and the CSP directive together.
- To restore it: pick the palette first (five to ten new tokens, each 4.5:1 on
  `#1A1A1A`, added to [Colour tokens](#colour-tokens), with a forced-colours
  decision),
  then a class-emitting highlighter (Prism, or Shiki with a CSS-variables
  theme).
- Never widen `style-src` to `'unsafe-inline'`. Hashing Shiki's output is not
  an option: the hashes change with every code block edit.

#### A post stops at `h3`. There is no `h4`

- `tests/headings.spec.ts` holds a post at 1280px and 320px to a 19px floor
  (`HEADING_FLOOR`) and a 0.8 step (`STEP`) between levels.
- At 320px `--text-post-h3` is at its 19px floor, so an `h4` would need to be
  at most 15.2px and at least 19px. The spec fails it at 320px.
- Rejected: raising the `h3` floor to 24px (a reflow change, SC 1.4.10);
  exempting level 4 from `STEP`.
- A post that needs a fourth level is reopened as a deliberate decision.

### Contents and tags

- The contents list is a `<nav aria-labelledby>` named by its `summary`, "In
  this post", around a native `<details>`.
- Closed below `xl`. From `xl`, `src/scripts/post-contents.ts` opens it and
  follows width changes. Without JavaScript it stays closed.
- The summary: `text-label` 900 uppercase in `text` (13.51 on `surface`), cyan
  on hover, at least 24px tall, a plus or minus marker hidden from assistive
  technology.
- Tags follow the text under a 4px `border` rule: a label 16px above a row of
  `.chip` links.

## Empty, loading and error states

A heading, a sentence, one way on. Enforced by `tests/empty-states.spec.ts`,

`tests/failed-images.spec.ts`.

- `.error-summary`: 8px `pink` edge on `surface`, `tabindex="-1"` and
  `autofocus`, no `role="alert"` (focus already announces it; some screen
  readers read an alert twice).
- A status region exists, empty, before anything is written to it.
- The only live regions: the contact form's status and the photo viewer's
  count. Every other state is its own page.
- The photo viewer decodes before it swaps, then writes `src`, caption and
  count together, so nothing is announced before it is painted.
- Loading holds: past 200ms the count reads "Loading photo 4 of 12" and the
  previous photo, caption and buttons stay. No blank frame. Under 200ms
  nothing is announced.
- A failed photo fades out; the frame reads "This photo could not be loaded."
  (`aria-hidden`), the count reads "Photo 4 of 12 could not be loaded", and the
  caption keeps the alt text.
- The message shows on the dialog's ground, never over the photograph.
- Each press takes a token; a decode holding an older token is discarded.

## Footer

`src/components/Footer.astro`, `src/styles/components/footer.css`.
Enforced by `tests/footer.spec.ts`.

### Footer structure

`<footer class="page-gutter">`, outside `<main>`, no headings:

- the name "Lepus Ridet" (`div lang="la"`, not a heading)
- `nav` "Site": Home, About, Career, Blog
- `nav` "About this site": Accessibility, Privacy, Credits
- `nav` "Social": seven sticker links, each an `aria-hidden` icon and a
  visually hidden name
- the copyright and the `aria-hidden` tuft

### Footer layout

| Width       | Layout                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| below 48rem | one centred column in source order; the stickers a 4-column grid, the last three offset by `--spacing(8)`; copyright over the tuft    |
| from 48rem  | three columns, name and stickers, Site, About this site, `column-gap` `--spacing(8)`; the copyright and tuft in one row, ends aligned |
| from 64rem  | inset `--spacing(8)` either side; stickers `--size-sticker-lg`                                                                        |

### Footer spacing

| Relationship                | Value                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Last section to footer      | that section's `--spacing-section`, then the footer's `--spacing(12)` top |
| Name to page links (phone)  | `--spacing(8)`                                                            |
| Stickers to copyright       | `--spacing(8)` at every width                                             |
| Between stickers            | `--spacing(6)`; `--spacing(4)` at 48rem; `--spacing(6)` at 64rem          |
| Copyright to the page's end | `--spacing(6)` from 48rem; the tuft sits on the edge below it             |

No rule or divider joins the footer to the page.

### Links and stickers

- Links are `.label`: Site in `text` (14.42), About this site in `subtle`
  (8.62), cyan on hover (11.20). Targets 40.8px on a phone, 32.8px from 48rem.
  No current-page state.
- Stickers: `--size-sticker` 48px (`--size-sticker-lg` 56px from 64rem),
  `--border-width-sticker` 4px `border` edge, 3deg tilt, 4px pink shadow with
  `lift-control`. They straighten on hover and focus.
- One colourway, the `.badge` inversion: `text` fill, `background` glyph
  (14.42). Not cycled by `nth-child`.
- Sizes are `@theme` tokens: `--size-sticker`, `--size-sticker-lg`,
  `--size-sticker-icon` (22px), `--border-width-sticker`, `--size-tuft` (220px),
  `--size-tuft-md` (266px).

## Navigation

`src/components/Header.astro`, `src/components/NavList.astro`,
`src/scripts/mobile-menu.ts`, `src/lib/nav.ts`.
Enforced by `tests/nav-current.spec.ts`, `tests/mobile-menu.spec.ts`,
`tests/no-script.spec.ts`, `tests/states.spec.ts`, `tests/focus.spec.ts`,
`tests/header-fit.spec.ts` and `tests/sticky-header.spec.ts`.

### By width

| Width       | Header                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| below 48rem | logo link, and the menu button that opens the menu dialog; without JavaScript, a nav row under the header instead |
| from 48rem  | logo link, the Primary nav (About, Career, Blog), and the call to action                                          |
| from 64rem  | the same on a three-track grid, the nav centred, wider gaps                                                       |

- Links come from `NAV_LINKS` and `CTA` in `src/lib/nav.ts`; the desktop
  header uses `HEADER_LINKS` (no Home; the logo links to `/`).
- Every nav link is at least 24px tall on its own (`py-2` + `border-4` =
  40.8px). Never rely on the SC 2.5.8 spacing exception.

### By height

- Sticky, 96px (`--spacing-header`). `html` keeps focus and anchors
  `--spacing-header` plus `--spacing(4)` below the top.
- Under 30rem of viewport height (`short`: a landscape phone, any window 960px
  tall or less at 200% zoom) it scrolls away and the scroll padding drops to
  `--spacing(4)`.
- Offset with `scroll-padding-top` on `html`, never `scroll-margin-top` on
  elements: WebKit ignores the latter for focused inputs.

### States

| Item                                    | Current                                                                                                                                          | Hover                                      | Focus                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nav link, menu link, no-JavaScript link | `aria-current`, `"page"` on the page and `"true"` inside its section, a flat `bg-text` block with a `border` edge, label in `background` (14.42) | cyan text (11.20), not on the current item | the 4px cyan ring at a 4px offset, on the current item too |
| Call to action                          | `aria-current`, `"page"` or `"true"`, shadow dropped, a 4px inset ring, pressed in                                                               | cyan fill                                  | the ring, offset past its shadow unless current            |
| Logo link                               | `aria-current="page"` on `/`, no visual state: the homepage hero says where you are                                                              | none                                       | the ring, offset past the tile's 8px shadow                |

- `ariaCurrent` in `src/lib/nav.ts` decides the value.
- Inactive items keep a `border-transparent` 4px edge so nothing reflows.
- A current chip is the same flat `bg-text` block, no shadow.

### The menu

- `src/scripts/mobile-menu.ts` loads at every width. Never gate it on a media
  query: 400% zoom crosses the breakpoint.
- A native `<dialog>` opened with `showModal()`: traps focus, closes on
  Escape, returns focus to the menu button. The button has `aria-expanded`,
  `aria-controls` and the fixed name "Menu". Background scroll is locked.
- Widening past 48rem while open leaves it open; it still closes with Escape
  or Close. Focus returns to the first Primary nav link, since the menu button
  is hidden at that width.

## Motion

- Every animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- Anything moving automatically for over five seconds needs a pause control
  (SC 2.2.2): the homepage hero field.
- Nothing flashes more than three times per second (SC 2.3.1).
- Controls press into their shadow at 0ms; no movement under reduced motion.
- No marquee.
- Pattern (`src/components/ui/HeroField.vue`): start the animation on mount,
  never in server HTML. Under reduced motion render one still frame and no
  button. The state lives in the accessible name ("Play the hero animation" /
  "Pause the hero animation"), no `aria-pressed`.
- `HeroField` loads `client:load`.

## Focus

- One global `:focus-visible` rule: `--focus-width` 4px cyan outline, offset
  `--focus-gap` 4px plus `--lift`. Never style `:focus`; never remove an
  outline; never `outline-offset: 0`.
- A hard shadow is not a focus indicator.
- `html` `scroll-padding-bottom` is the ring's width, gap and `--lift-object`,
  so a control scrolled to the bottom edge keeps its whole ring on screen.
- On gold the ring is `gold-text`. Ratios: [Contrast](#contrast).
- `--lift-control` 4px beside a 4px shadow, `--lift-object` 8px beside an 8px
  shadow, so the ring clears the shadow (cyan on pink is 2.29). The button,
  `.nav-cta` and `.chip` classes carry it. A current item with no shadow sets
  `--lift: 0px`. A new shadow without its lift is a bug.
- Chip lists and the no-JavaScript nav are `gap-6` so one chip's ring never
  meets the next chip's shadow. `tests/states.spec.ts` measures it.
- `.btn-gold-primary` has a two-tone ring, because its ring colour equals its
  fill: `--inset-shadow-gold-btn-ring` and `shadow-hard-bunny-4` in one
  `box-shadow`, so focus keeps the shadow. Use a two-tone ring only when the
  ring colour equals the control's opaque fill.

| Layer                           | Against        | Ratio |
| ------------------------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| inner `#FFFFFF`, 3px, inset     | `#131313` fill | 18.58 |
| outer `#131313`, beyond the gap | gold `#FFC000` | 11.32 |

- `.card-solid`'s ring is `background` ([Markup](#markup)).
- Any new surface measures its own ring twice: against the ground behind the
  element (the offset gap) and against the element's own edge.
- Native media controls: `:is(video, audio)[controls]:is(:focus, :focus-within)`
  gets the same 4px cyan ring at a 4px offset.

## Photo frames and the failed-photo state

Without the frame holding the shape, WebKit draws a failed photo square and
shows no alt text. Enforced by `tests/replaced-elements.spec.ts` and
`tests/failed-images.spec.ts` in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit.

### The frame

- Every photo sits in an `.aspect-frame` and fills it (`absolute inset-0
size-full object-cover`). Never put `aspect-ratio` on the image: WebKit
  drops it, and the ratio from `width` and `height`, when the image fails.
- A designed ratio is a class on the frame: `aspect-portrait` (4:5, hero),
  `aspect-photo` (4:3, blog cover), `aspect-square`, `aspect-video` (16:9,
  `lg:aspect-2/1` for the About panorama).
- A file's own ratio is an `.aspect-sizer`: an empty `aria-hidden` SVG whose
  viewBox is the file's width and height. PhotoTile reads it from image
  metadata; post photos get it at build time in `src/plugins/post-figure.mjs`.
  An inline style is refused by the CSP.
- The frame carries the border and shadow: `border` 4px on the page (4.84 on
  `background`, 4.53 on `surface`), `gold-text` on the hero slab (11.32).
- `min-w-0`: WebKit gives a grid item with an aspect ratio a minimum width
  wider than its track.

### The failed state

| Part     | Treatment                                                    | Ratio               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Frame    | `surface` fill, its own border and shadow                    | border as above     |
| Image    | `opacity: 0`; stays in the accessibility tree with its alt   |                     |
| Alt text | a copy in `.aspect-frame-alt`, `aria-hidden`, `text`         | 13.51 on `surface`  |
| Size     | `text-body`, inset 16px; `text-label` inset 12px below 20rem | 13.51 at both sizes |
| Overflow | clamped to the whole lines the frame holds, then an ellipsis |                     |

- `src/scripts/failed-images.ts` sets `data-failed` on the frame. It checks
  each image on arrival (`complete` with no `naturalWidth`), on `error`, and
  again on `load`.
- It sets `--alt-lines` to the whole lines that fit between the insets and
  recounts on resize. Inset, not padding: `overflow` clips at the padding edge.
- A decorative photo (`alt=""`) is marked and shows the empty fill.
- No announcement: the alt is still the accessible name.
- Without JavaScript nothing is marked; the frame keeps its shape and fill and
  the browser's broken-image state shows (alt text in Chromium and Firefox,
  an icon in WebKit).
