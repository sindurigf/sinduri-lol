# AGENTS.md

Rules for anyone, human or agent, changing this repository. Stack, design
system and conventions: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Done means

```sh
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run check        # tokens, links, pins, classes, untransformed, format, commits
npm run test:a11y    # Chromium, Firefox; WebKit in CI or with WEBKIT=1
npm run test:webkit  # test:a11y in WebKit via Docker
npm run test:worker  # WORKER_SPECS through the Worker
```

- CI runs all of it; `Required checks` is the one required status.
- A suite passed only if its summary total matches `npx playwright test --list`.
- Green means the steps ran, not that the tests assert the right things.
- Report and fix every warning, hint, error and flaky test, pre-existing or
  not, in its own commit. A false positive is named with its reason.
- Two runs of unchanged code that disagree: suspect the environment first
  (a stray build or Astro process, memory pressure).

### What a test is for

Name what a test protects: function, WCAG 2.2 AA, SEO and feeds, performance,
security and privacy, or build correctness. "Looks as designed" is not one.

- Decoration is not tested for its look (canvas drawing, shadow hues, pixel
  gaps). A red decorative test is deleted or cut to its accessibility core.
- Accessibility rules about decoration are tested: reduced motion, pause
  control, hidden from assistive technology, never covering text.
- Interaction states (hover, focus, active, visited, current, disabled) are
  accessibility: SC 1.4.3, 1.4.11, 1.4.1.
- Assert the property ("at least 4.5:1 and differs from rest"), not the value
  (`rgb(0, 255, 255)`).

### Which suites to run

CI runs the full gate on every pull request. Locally, before opening one:

- `build`, `typecheck`, `check` and `test:worker`.
- The specs the change touches or whose behaviour it changes, in every engine:
  `npx playwright test <specs>` and `npm run test:webkit -- <specs>`.

State what ran in the pull request.

## Review findings

A finding is a claim until it holds against the code. Read the code, measure
the behaviour, look for why it is written that way, and fix only what survives.
Record rejected findings beside the code so they are not raised again;
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#rejected-findings) lists the current ones.

## Git and pull requests

- Branch per task from `main`, named for the task.
- Open a pull request with `gh pr create --base main --body-file <file>`, using
  [the template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Never `--fill`.
- CI must pass. The owner reviews and merges.
- One commit per logical change.
- Do not rename the `Required checks` job
  ([why](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#repository-settings)).

### PR descriptions

- Bullets. One fact per line. File or function name first.
- What changed and why, then how it was tested (commands and totals).
- No narrative, no restating the diff, no "Not applicable" lines. Leave out
  sections that do not apply.

## Commits

`type: Full sentence with a full stop.` No scope; capital after the colon.

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `chore`, `perf`, `security`,
`config`, `revert`, `test`.

No AI attribution trailers in commits or PRs. [AI_DISCLOSURE.md](AI_DISCLOSURE.md)
covers attribution once. `scripts/check-commits.sh` enforces it in CI;
`.githooks/commit-msg` strips trailers locally once
[enabled](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#setup).

## Code

- Idiomatic Astro, Vue, TypeScript and Playwright. Follow the framework's docs
  before inventing a pattern.
- Functional style, no classes without a reason.
- Named constants, no magic numbers.
- Validate external input at the boundary; never swallow errors.
- Reuse existing patterns and dependencies. Ask before installing a package.
- Vue only for components with real state (`HeroField.vue`). Small
  scripts are plain modules, e.g. `src/scripts/mobile-menu.ts`.

## Comments

Default: none. Rename or extract a function instead.

Write one only when the code cannot say it:

- why this approach and not the obvious one
- a browser bug or spec constraint, with a link
- units, ranges, or two places that must agree

Rules:

- One line. Three at most. Longer belongs in ARCHITECTURE.md or a test.
- Present tense. No history, dates, "used to", or narrative of what was tried.
- No restating the code, the signature, or the test name.
- No banners, no numbered essays in docblocks, no TODO comments.
- Tests: the test name says what is asserted. Assertion messages state the
  failure in one sentence.

## Docs

- Reference, not prose. Short bullets, tables for tabular facts, commands in
  code blocks.
- Say each fact once, in one file. Link instead of repeating.
- No dates or measurements unless the number is the rule (a budget, a ratio).

## Copy

- Functional microcopy (labels, errors, alt text, skip link, empty states) is
  written by whoever builds the UI. Plain, short, second person.
- Editorial copy (posts, About, Career, taglines, bios, anything in Sinduri's
  voice) is never invented. It stays lorem ipsum until the owner writes it.

## Hard rules

- Never commit anything from `design/`. The published CV is
  `public/sinduri-guntupalli-cv.pdf`.
- Read `.claude/skills/sinduri-design-system/` before UI, colour or component
  work.

## Where things are

- Documentation: [README.md](README.md#documentation).
- `.claude/skills/sinduri-design-system/`: design system for agents
- `design/`: comps, gitignored. `tmp/`: scratch, gitignored.
