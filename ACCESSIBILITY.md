# Accessibility

What sinduri.lol aims for, what is tested, what is not, and how to report a
barrier. The public summary is [/accessibility](https://sinduri.lol/accessibility).

The statement is voluntary for a personal site and follows the
[W3C model for accessibility statements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/).

## 1. Project information

| Field               | Value                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project             | sinduri.lol                                                |
| Project type        | Static personal website (Astro, two Vue islands, Tailwind) |

| Public reporting    | <https://github.com/sindurigf/sinduri-lol/issues>          |
| Private reporting   | <lol@sinduri.lol>                                          |
| Target standard     | WCAG 2.2 Level AA, with AAA text contrast                  |
| Conformance status  | **Target only. No claim that the site meets it.**          |
| Last reviewed       | 2026-10-02                                                 |
| Response time       | 7 days                                                     |

`src/lib/accessibility-facts.ts` reads the Target standard, Conformance status,
Last reviewed, Response time and both reporting rows into `/accessibility` at
build time and throws if a row is missing. `tests/accessibility-page.spec.ts` asserts the
status is still "Target only. No claim that the site meets it."

## 2. Commitment

- WCAG 2.2 AA is the floor. AAA criteria are met where practical (below).
- Both color modes are measured: dark by default, light on request.
- Keyboard first: every control is reachable, visible when focused, and never
  hidden under the sticky header.
- No motion traps: what moves and how it stops is under Motion in
  [section 4](#4-what-the-site-supports).
- Native HTML before ARIA.
- Every color is measured against every ground it is used on.
- Automated checks run in CI and a violation blocks the merge.
- Untested means untested: gaps are listed in [section 7](#7-known-gaps), not
  implied away.

### AAA criteria in scope

| Criterion                            | What we do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)            | Every text token at rest clears 7:1 on every ground it is used on, dark, light and gold. Exception: the category glyph on `/`, `background` on `pink`, is 4.90:1 and passes as large text only. `pink` is never text; `pink-text` is. Ratios: [contrast table](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#contrast).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1.4.8 Visual Presentation            | `tests/visual-presentation.spec.ts`, every route at 390, 1280 and 1920: a visible `p`, `li` or `dd` of more than one sentence has at most 80 characters a line, line height 1.5 or more and no justification; each `p` followed by a `p` leaves 2.5em of the larger text from its last line box's top to the next one's first. Width at 200%: `tests/reflow.spec.ts`. Colors: browsers can override them (G156); the theme switch offers light and dark (`tests/light-mode.spec.ts`).                                                                              |
| 2.2.4 Interruptions                  | Nothing interrupts: no alerts, assertive live regions or automatic refresh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions    | See Motion in [section 4](#4-what-the-site-supports).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only)       | Within a page, one link name leads to one place. Hidden text completes short names: "Drupal tag", "Sinduri on GitHub". Exception: link text in posts, listed in `tests/link-purpose.spec.ts`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2.4.12 Focus Not Obscured (Enhanced) | No focused control is even partly covered. On pages, none sits under the sticky header in either Tab direction (`tests/focus.spec.ts`); the About cats' sleep and trick controls sit beside their cat buttons, and Rudra's band ends at the raised card above it; inside the open cat card, photo viewer and menu, every stop is wholly uncovered (`tests/focus-obscured.spec.ts`).                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2.4.13 Focus Appearance              | One solid ring, `--focus-width` wide. At every page focus stop it covers at least a 2px perimeter of the control and reaches 3:1 against the ground it paints over.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced)         | Every pointer target outside a sentence has a 44 by 44px area of its own, never shared: controls are drawn at `--spacing-target` (44px); header and breadcrumb links get a pointer area wider than their drawn box (`.hit-target`); footer links are 44px rows. `tests/target-size.spec.ts` hit-tests every target on every page and in every open dialog at 305px and 1280px.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms    | No input is turned off because another one was detected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 3.1.3 Unusual Words                  | On functional pages (statement, privacy, credits, brand), jargon is written in plain words, or defined in the sentence of its first use and marked with `<dfn>` (G112, H54). `/404` links its Star Wars lines to their explanation on `/credits` (G55). Posts, About, Career and the contact page's greeting are the owner's copy and are not checked.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 3.1.4 Abbreviations                  | On functional pages (statement, privacy, brand), each abbreviation's first use is a `<button popovertarget>` around an `<abbr>`, described by its expansion (`aria-describedby`). A tap or Enter opens the expansion with no script, and Escape or a press elsewhere closes it; a script adds hover and focus and places it under the abbreviation. A browser without popovers reads the expansion inline in brackets, and the script removes the button there. `/credits` spells the words out. Posts, About and Career are the owner's copy and are not checked. |
| 3.2.5 Change on Request              | No new windows, automatic refresh or navigation by script.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

axe's `wcag2aaa` rules are not run.

## 3. Scope and supported environments

In scope:

- Every route in `tests/routes.ts`, and the layouts, components, tokens and
  Markdown they are built from.
- `/contact/send/`, the one on-demand route, tested over HTTP and, for its
  error pages, in Chromium (`tests/contact.spec.ts`).
- The two PDFs: `public/sinduri-guntupalli-cv.pdf` and
  `public/talks/open-source-is-not-just-code.pdf`.

Not in scope: third-party sites linked from the footer, the talk presenter
view (development server only, never published), and forks.

| Environment      | Support                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browsers         | Baseline Widely Available ([ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#browser-support))                                                      |
| Engines tested   | Chromium and Firefox locally and in CI; WebKit in CI and through Docker (`npm run test:webkit`)                                     |
| Color modes      | Dark by default. With JavaScript, light follows `prefers-color-scheme: light`, can be set with the header switch, and is remembered |
| Forced colors    | Windows High Contrast (`forced-colors: active`)                                                                                     |
| No JavaScript    | Navigation and the contact form work; the page stays dark and the light-mode switch is hidden; the hero field renders still         |
| Zoom and spacing | 400% zoom at 1280px (320px reflow), SC 1.4.12 text spacing                                                                          |
| Screen readers   | None tested. See [gap 2](#7-known-gaps)                                                                                             |

## 4. What the site supports

- **axe, WCAG tags.** Every route passes `wcag2a`, `wcag2aa`, `wcag21a`,
  `wcag21aa` and `wcag22aa` with no rule disabled and no result excluded, in
  dark mode, in light mode, at 320px in both, and with the mobile menu open.
  The photo viewer open, a post's contents open and the talk past its cover
  are scanned too. The experimental rules in those tags, which axe ships off,
  are turned on (`AXE_EXPERIMENTAL_RULES` in `tests/wcag.ts`).
- **axe, best practice.** Every route passes `best-practice` in its own block.
- **Undecided results.** Every `incomplete` result from those scans is decided
  (`tests/incomplete.ts`): contrast by walking the paint stack, label in name
  (SC 2.5.3) by passing only a control whose visible text is symbols, which
  [Understanding 2.5.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/label-in-name.html)
  puts out of scope.
- **Reflow.** No route scrolls sideways at 305px (320px less a classic 15px
  scrollbar, the stricter case), with and without the SC 1.4.12 override, or at
  640px, 1280px and 1920px. The content box matches the
  [heading floors](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#heading-floors), no heading word is wider
  than its box, and no text or control sits past either edge.
- **Text resize.** Every text token reaches 2x by page zoom in Chromium and
  Firefox ([Text resize](#text-resize-sc-144)).
- **Target size.** A 44px square centered on every target outside a sentence
  hits only that target, at 305px and 1280px, on every page (listings sampled
  as below) and in the open cat card, photo viewer and menu (SC 2.5.5).
- **Keyboard.** The tab order is walked in both directions on every page at
  two widths; category and tag listings, one template differing only by label,
  are walked once per group that shows the same posts. Each stop is hit-tested
  against the sticky header, with no part under it (SC 2.4.11, 2.4.12), and
  its ring measured against the ground it lands on (SC 1.4.11) and for area
  (SC 2.4.13). Inside the open cat card, photo viewer and menu, no stop is even
  partly covered (SC 2.4.12).
- **Sticky header.** Below 30rem of viewport height the header scrolls away
  instead of covering the page.
- **Focus ring.** One global ring, offset past the element's shadow, measured
  on every ground ([STYLEGUIDE Focus](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#focus)).
- **Mobile menu.** A native modal `<dialog>` that returns focus and works at
  400% zoom ([STYLEGUIDE The menu](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#the-menu)).
- **No JavaScript.** A fallback navigation replaces the mobile menu, sits
  below the header and never duplicates the primary nav.
- **Current page.** `aria-current` in all three navigations, plus a shape
  change, never color alone.
- **Headings and titles.** One `h1`, no skipped level, nothing under 19px.
  Every `<title>` is distinct, and every one but the homepage's names the
  page before the site.
- **Language.** One language, declared in `<html lang>`, `og:locale`,
  structured data and the feed. Latin phrases carry `lang="la"`.
- **Alt text.** Every image in the build is named or decorative on purpose;
  a failed photo shows its alt text on its frame without doubling it for a
  screen reader.
- **Motion.** The hero field on `/` has a pause control and each cat on
  `/about` a sleep control (SC 2.2.2). Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
  the hero field is drawn once and held, the cats sit still, and a pressed
  control does not move into its shadow (SC 2.3.3); nothing else animates
  ([STYLEGUIDE Motion](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#motion)).
- **Forced colors.** Every non-link control keeps a painted border or opaque
  background, links are distinct from body text, every focus stop on `/`
  keeps an outline, and the menu button's bars take `ButtonText`.
- **Contact form.** Labels with "(required)" in words, `autocomplete` on name
  and email (SC 1.3.5), a focused error summary on failure, typed values kept
  on a 422, `aria-disabled` on the button and a `role="status"` message while
  sending, with no `aria-busy` to hold that message back. Details
  in gap 1.
- **CV PDF.** The photo and shapes are artifacts, the name is the H1 and the
  six section titles are H2s. The photo is decorative
  ([why](ARCHITECTURE.md#content-notes)). Firefox's PDF viewer exposes that
  structure, and `npm run check:pdf` passes it. Job and course titles are
  body text on purpose, because Canva exports give them inconsistent levels
  ([MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) §13.4 flags this). How it is
  made: [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#publishing-the-cv).
- **Talk PDF.** Passes PDF/UA-1 in `npm run check:pdf`. See gap 6.

Passing axe is not conformance.

### Text resize (SC 1.4.4)

[Understanding 1.4.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text.html):
"it should still be possible to get 200% text enlargement in some way
compared to the default 100% zoom". Text tokens with a `vw` or `svh` term grow
less than the zoom factor, so 2x comes at a higher page zoom.

- **Met by:** page zoom up to 500% in Chromium and Firefox.
  `tests/text-resize.spec.ts` finds the lowest zoom that reaches 2x for every
  such token at 390, 1000, 1280 and 1920px and fails if none does.
- **Headroom:** a token at 500% in the table reaches 2x only at the
  browsers' ceiling.
- **Safari:** its Page Zoom setting stops at 300% on macOS and iOS. Tokens
  past 300% below reach 2x there only through system magnification (Zoom on
  macOS and iOS). The site does not use Dynamic Type (`-apple-system-body`).
  Known limit.
- **Text-only zoom:** Firefox "Zoom Text Only" scales the `rem` parts only, so `vw` text does not reach 2x that way. Under
  [F94](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F94) one working
  method is enough.

Lowest page zoom, in %, at which each token reaches 2x its 100% size, by
window width. Chromium, with Firefox in brackets where its zoom steps differ.

## 5. Color and contrast

Every token, ratio and color rule is in [docs/STYLEGUIDE.md](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md).
The [contrast table](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#contrast) there is generated from the
CSS and `tests/contrast-table.spec.ts` fails when it drifts.

### Dark surfaces

- `text`, `subtle`, `gold`, `cyan` and `pink-text` clear 7:1 on `background`
  and `surface`.
- `border` carries every boundary and clears SC 1.4.11.
- `pink` is non-text only; `pink-text` carries every pink glyph.
- The focus ring clears every shadow it could touch
  ([Focus](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#focus)).

### The gold surface

A full or thin PageHero slab, the closing band on `/contact`, the kindness
quote on `/about` and any `Section surface="gold"` are `#FFC000`. Every dark
token fails on it, so `.surface-gold` swaps in a near-black set, links stay
underlined (SC 1.4.1) and the dark buttons are replaced by gold ones:
[Gold surface](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#gold-surface).

### The solid block

`.card-solid` is a `text` fill where only `background` passes, so everything
inside, the focus ring included, is `background` (`tests/solid-block.spec.ts`,
[Markup](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#markup)).

### Light mode

The header switch turns `<main>` light; the header and footer stay dark. Every
text color clears 4.5:1 on white:
[Light mode](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#light-mode).

## 6. How it is tested

### Automated

Playwright runs the production build in Chromium and Firefox, and WebKit in
CI, on every pull request and every push to `main`. Any failure blocks the
merge.

Limits:

- Only rules in the WCAG A and AA tags, experimental ones included, and
  `best-practice` run. A green suite says nothing about AAA rules.
- A contrast rule measures a label against its own control, not the control
  against the ground: a control with no visible edge passes axe.
  `tests/gold-surface.spec.ts` checks fill or border against the ground.
- `overflow-wrap: break-word` hides a heading floor that is too large: the
  heading breaks mid-word instead of overflowing. The heading word fit check
  covers this.
- `tests/forced-colors.spec.ts` skips all but one test on WebKit, which
  reports `forced-colors: active` and paints the author palette anyway. The
  remaining test fails if that changes in any engine.
- Headless WebKit is not Safari and says nothing about VoiceOver.

### Manual

[docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) is the checklist. Run and
passed: from §9, the mobile menu button, footer profile tiles and mobile menu
links. Not automated:

- Whether the focus order makes sense and the ring is easy to find.
- Screen reader announcements, including how CSS-uppercased names are read
  (Chromium exposes `"ABOUT"` for markup `About`).
- Reduced motion, 400% zoom and text-only zoom, by hand.
- Firefox and Safari, by hand.
- Plain language, cognitive load and reading order.
- Jargon or idioms not yet listed (SC 3.1.3): no machine tells a term of art
  from an ordinary word, so a person reads the functional pages for them.

## 7. Known gaps

1. **The contact form's error path is untested by a person.** Asserted over
   HTTP: labels, a 422 keeping typed values, `aria-invalid`, summary links,
   "(required)" in each label, honeypot, rate limit. Asserted in the browser:
   `aria-disabled` and "Sending" on the button, the status text, no busy
   ancestor, no second submit, and the back-forward cache reset. Asserted in
   Chromium only, through the Worker: on the 422 and 503 pages focus lands on
   the summary (`tabindex="-1" autofocus`, no `role="alert"`, to avoid a double
   read), axe finds no WCAG 2.2 A or AA violation, typed values stay, each hint
   and error stays tied to its field, and no focused control is covered at
   320px and 1280px, walking Tab from the summary and Shift+Tab from the last
   footer link. In markup only: `novalidate` and the inset pink error ring.
   `/contact/send/` is outside `tests/routes.ts`, so the route suites never
   render the error state and Firefox and WebKit never see it.
   Nobody has judged whether the messages help (SC 3.3.1, 3.3.3) or heard them
   with a screen reader. SC 3.3.7 and 3.3.8 do not apply.
2. **No screen reader testing.** No NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver or Orca run.
   [MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) §6 is an Orca pass in Firefox,
   with §6.4 in Chrome for the uppercase question. An Orca pass narrows this
   gap; it does not close it.
3. **The gold surface has been measured, not looked at.**
   `tests/gold-surface.spec.ts` measures every route at 1280px, and one
   button at 305px:

   | Measured                                             | Result                                               |
   | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
   | every string on a gold ground                        | nothing below 4.5:1                                  |
   | every control in `.surface-gold`                     | its fill differs from gold, or its border clears 3:1 |
   | `/contact`'s `.btn-gold-primary` focus ring at 305px | inner `#FFFFFF` ring at 3:1 or more against its fill |

   The inner ring is 18.58 against the `#131313` fill by the tokens; the test
   asserts 3:1. Nobody has tabbed, zoomed or listened to a gold band.
   [MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) §5 checks the ring on gold by
   eye only, so it does not close this gap.

4. **Fixture and in-situ gold tests cover different mistakes.** Fixtures can be
   broken on purpose; only the in-situ test catches a mistake in a shipped
   route. Both stay.
5. **Prose has not been judged.** Reading order, heading usefulness and link
   text out of context have not been assessed by a person on any page.
6. **The talk PDF has not been read with a screen reader.**
   `public/talks/open-source-is-not-just-code.pdf` passes PDF/UA-1 in
   `npm run check:pdf`: tagged, English, a bookmark and heading per slide, alt
   text on both images, a description on every link.
   `tests/talk-pdf.spec.ts` fails when `slides.md` changes without a reprint.
   Reading order across cards, how capitalized slide labels are spoken, and
   whether viewers expose the structure are unchecked
   ([MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) §13). The HTML slideshow at
   `/talks/open-source-is-not-just-code/` passes the route suites; nobody has
   heard it (§13.5), and no person has compared it slide for slide with the
   original deck. Carried in text: slide 14's
   screenshot, slide 26's pairs (as a table), the pillar and topic groupings.
   Left off: the four Lord of the Rings images with their captions and
   credits (the GIFs need a pause control, the captions do not stand alone,
   and licensing is unverified), and the labels above 27 slide titles that
   restate them.
7. **Talk slide text does not reach 2x at 200% zoom (SC 1.4.4).**
   `--text-slide` and `--text-slide-title` follow the screen, so zoom shrinks
   them with it: at 1280x720 zoomed to 200%, slide titles stay the same size
   (1.0x) and full-screen body text grows 1.48x. Page-view body text uses
   `--text-body` and grows 2x. `tests/slideshow.spec.ts` asserts only that
   nothing is cut off at 200%.

## 8. Reporting a barrier

If something on this site blocks you, report it. You do not need to know the
WCAG criterion or say anything about yourself.

- **Public:** <https://github.com/sindurigf/sinduri-lol/issues>
- **Private:** <lol@sinduri.lol>

Useful, never required: the page, what you tried and what happened, your
browser, operating system and assistive technology, a screenshot.

Replies aim to arrive within the Response time in [section 1](#1-project-information).

Content that does not work for someone is sent another way on request, for
example as plain text.

| Severity | Meaning                                                  | Priority                 |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Blocker  | You cannot complete a task (read, navigate, send a form) | Above everything else    |
| Serious  | You can complete it only with a workaround or with help  | Next, before new work    |
| Moderate | It works but is confusing, slow or tiring                | Scheduled with new work  |
| Minor    | Cosmetic or best practice; nothing is blocked            | When the area is touched |

## 9. Contributor checklist

Rules this repository follows. Values and reasons:
[docs/STYLEGUIDE.md](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md).

- **Contrast.** Measure a new color on every ground it can meet
  ([Adding a color](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#adding-a-color)). Never `pink` on
  text; never `pink-text` on non-text.
- **Gold.** Build gold grounds with `.surface-gold` only. Never the dark
  tokens, `.btn-primary` or `.btn-secondary` on gold.
- **Focus.** Never remove an outline. A focusable element that casts a shadow
  sets `lift-control` or `lift-object`. A new ground gets its ring measured
  against the ground and the element's edge. Never `outline-offset: 0`.
- **Keyboard.** Check tab order in both directions: Shift+Tab is the direction
  that goes under the sticky header.
- **Targets.** A 44x44px pointer area of its own, never overlapping another.
- **Motion.** [STYLEGUIDE Motion](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#motion).
- **Semantics.** Native elements first: `<button>`, `<dialog>`, `<details>`.
  One `h1`, no skipped level. Name a `<section>` only with its visible
  heading. No "navigation" in a nav label.
- **Case.** Follow the [case rule](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#uppercase) and uppercase with CSS.
- **Images.** Alt describes the content, never the type or filename; `alt=""`
  when decorative. Never text over a photograph; the axe scans fail it. Photos
  sit in an `.aspect-frame`.
- **Links.** Underlined in running text. Link text makes sense on its own.
  Current page: `aria-current` plus a shape change, never color alone.
- **SVG.** Decorative SVG is `aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"`.
- **ARIA.** Only where no native element works, with a comment saying why.
  No `aria-label` over visible text, except one that repeats it exactly: the
  logo link, where a `<wbr>` splits Chromium's computed name. A toggle with
  `aria-expanded` or `aria-pressed` keeps a constant name; the hero's transport
  control is named for its action, "Pause the hero animation" or "Play the
  hero animation".
- **Media.** No embedded players: an `<iframe>` hides its media from
  `tests/media-alternatives.spec.ts`. A `<video id>` has a captions track
  (1.2.2) and links with `data-media-for="<id>"` and `data-media-alternative`
  of `transcript` (1.2.8), `sign-language` (1.2.6) and `extended-description`
  (1.2.7). An `<audio id>` has a `transcript` link (1.2.1) and
  `data-background-audio-checked` once a person has heard background sound
  stay 20 dB under speech (1.4.7).
- **Forms.** Visible labels with "(required)" in words, `autocomplete` on
  personal fields, `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` on errors, a focused
  error summary. `aria-disabled`, never `disabled`, on buttons.
- **Forced colors.** A control bounded only by a shadow has no edge in forced
  colors: give it a border or an opaque fill.
- **Reflow.** Never add horizontal padding to a page container. A display
  heading word over twelve characters takes a soft hyphen.
- **Conflicting needs.** When one group's need works against another's, name
  both groups, choose, and record the choice and its reason in this file. A
  W3C note, opinion here, gives an example:
  [low vision needs](https://www.w3.org/TR/low-vision-needs/), high contrast
  against light sensitivity.
- **Scripts.** Never hold content back behind a script. What a page says is in
  its HTML; a script only adds to it. Tested for navigation
  (`tests/no-script.spec.ts`) and the talk slides (`tests/slideshow.spec.ts`).
- **Sources.** WCAG and its Understanding documents are normative. Mark any
  other source cited here, an article, checklist or tool, as opinion.
- **Unusual words.** On a functional page, write jargon in plain words. Where
  the term is needed, define it in the sentence of its first use, mark it with
  `<dfn>`, and list it in `tests/unusual-words.spec.ts`.
- **This file.** Update it in the same commit as the change. A gap is removed
  when it has been tested, not when it was fixed in passing.

## 10. Criteria that do not apply
