# Accessibility

What sinduri.lol aims for, what is tested, what is not, and how to report a
barrier. The public summary is [/accessibility](https://sinduri.lol/accessibility).

## 1. Project information

| Field               | Value                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project             | sinduri.lol                                                |
| Project type        | Static personal website (Astro, one Vue island, Tailwind)  |
| Accessibility owner | Sinduri Guntupalli                                         |
| Public reporting    | <https://github.com/sindurigf/sinduri-lol/issues>          |
| Private reporting   | <lol@sinduri.lol>                                          |
| Target standard     | WCAG 2.2 Level AA, with AAA text contrast where achievable |
| Conformance status  | **Target only. No conformance claim.**                     |
| Last reviewed       | 2026-09-19                                                 |

`src/lib/accessibility-facts.ts` reads the Target standard, Conformance status,
Last reviewed and both reporting rows into `/accessibility` at build time and
throws if a row is missing. `tests/accessibility-page.spec.ts` asserts the
status is still "Target only. No conformance claim."

## 2. Commitment

- WCAG 2.2 AA is the floor. AAA criteria are met where practical (below).
- Both colour modes are measured: dark by default, light on request.
- Keyboard first: every control is reachable, visible when focused, and never
  hidden under the sticky header.
- No motion traps: the one animation can be paused, and nothing moves under
  `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- Native HTML before ARIA.
- Every colour is measured against every ground it is used on.
- Automated checks run in CI and a violation blocks the merge.
- Untested means untested: gaps are listed in [section 7](#7-known-gaps), not
  implied away.

### AAA criteria in scope

| Criterion                         | What we do                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced)         | Every text token at rest clears 7:1 on every ground it is used on, dark, light and gold. Exception: light-mode hover `cyan` is AA only. `pink` is never text; `pink-text` is. Ratios: [contrast table](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#contrast). |
| 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions | Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` a pressed control does not move into its shadow and the hero field is drawn once and held (`tests/motion.spec.ts`).                                                                           |

Out of scope: SC 2.4.13 Focus Appearance and SC 2.5.5 Target Size (Enhanced,
44px). axe's `wcag2aaa` rules are not run.

## 3. Scope and supported environments

In scope:

- Every route in `tests/routes.ts`, and the layouts, components, tokens and
  Markdown they are built from.
- `/contact/send/`, the one on-demand route, tested over HTTP only
  (`tests/contact.spec.ts`).
- The two PDFs: `public/sinduri-guntupalli-cv.pdf` and
  `public/talks/open-source-is-not-just-code.pdf`.

Not in scope: third-party sites linked from the footer, the talk presenter
view (development server only, never published), and forks.

| Environment      | Support                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Browsers         | Baseline Widely Available ([ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#browser-support))                                                      |
| Engines tested   | Chromium and Firefox locally and in CI; WebKit in CI and through Docker (`npm run test:webkit`)                                     |
| Colour modes     | Dark by default. With JavaScript, light follows `prefers-color-scheme: light`, can be set with the header switch, and is remembered |
| Forced colours   | Windows High Contrast (`forced-colors: active`)                                                                                     |
| No JavaScript    | Navigation and the contact form work; the page stays dark and the light-mode switch is hidden; the hero field renders still         |
| Zoom and spacing | 400% zoom at 1280px (320px reflow), SC 1.4.12 text spacing                                                                          |
| Screen readers   | None tested. See [gap 2](#7-known-gaps)                                                                                             |

## 4. What the site supports

- **axe, WCAG tags.** Every route passes `wcag2a`, `wcag2aa`, `wcag21a`,
  `wcag21aa` and `wcag22aa` with no rule disabled and no result excluded, in
  dark mode, in light mode, at 320px in both, and with the mobile menu open.
  The photo viewer open, a post's contents open and the talk past its cover
  are scanned too.
- **axe, best practice.** Every route passes `best-practice` in its own block.
- **Undecided contrast.** Every `incomplete` result from those scans is decided
  by walking the paint stack (`tests/incomplete.ts`).
- **Reflow.** No route scrolls sideways at 305px (320px less a classic 15px
  scrollbar, the stricter case), with and without the SC 1.4.12 override, or at
  640px, 1280px and 1920px. The content box matches the
  [heading floors](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#heading-floors), no heading word is wider
  than its box, and no text or control sits past either edge.
- **Target size.** Every target passes SC 2.5.8 on its own size at 305px and
  1280px (listings sampled as below). The spacing exception is not relied on
  anywhere, so a spacing change cannot silently break 2.5.8.
- **Keyboard.** The tab order is walked in both directions on every page at
  two widths; category and tag listings, one template differing only by label,
  are walked once per group that shows the same posts. Each stop is hit-tested
  against the sticky header (SC 2.4.11) and its ring measured against the
  ground it lands on (SC 1.4.11).
- **Sticky header.** Below 30rem of viewport height the header scrolls away
  instead of covering the page.
- **Focus ring.** One global ring, offset past the element's shadow, measured
  on every ground ([STYLEGUIDE Focus](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#focus)).
- **Mobile menu.** A native modal `<dialog>` that returns focus and works at
  400% zoom ([STYLEGUIDE The menu](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#the-menu)).
- **No JavaScript.** A fallback navigation replaces the mobile menu, sits
  below the header and never duplicates the primary nav.
- **Current page.** `aria-current` in all three navigations, plus a shape
  change, never colour alone.
- **Headings and titles.** One `h1`, no skipped level, nothing under 19px.
  Every `<title>` is distinct, and every one but the homepage's names the
  page before the site.
- **Language.** One language, declared in `<html lang>`, `og:locale`,
  structured data and the feed. Latin phrases carry `lang="la"`.
- **Alt text.** Every image in the build is named or decorative on purpose;
  a failed photo shows its alt text on its frame without doubling it for a
  screen reader.
- **Motion.** The hero field on `/` has a pause control (SC 2.2.2) and is
  still under reduced motion; nothing else animates
  ([STYLEGUIDE Motion](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#motion)).
- **Forced colours.** Every non-link control keeps a painted border or opaque
  background, links are distinct from body text, and the focus ring keeps its
  width.
- **Contact form.** Labels with "(required)" in words, `autocomplete` on name
  and email (SC 1.3.5), a focused error summary on failure, typed values kept
  on a 422, `aria-disabled` on the button and a `role="status"` message while
  sending, with no `aria-busy` to hold that message back. Details
  in gap 1.
- **CV PDF.** `npm run publish:cv` tags it: the photo and shapes as
  artifacts, the name as H1 and six section titles as H2. The photo is
  decorative ([why](ARCHITECTURE.md#content-notes)). Firefox's PDF viewer
  exposes that structure, and `npm run check:pdf` passes it with nothing
  tagged inside an artifact. Job and course titles are tagged as body text on
  purpose, because Canva exports give them inconsistent levels
  ([MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) §13.4 flags this).
- **Talk PDF.** Passes PDF/UA-1 in `npm run check:pdf`. See gap 6.

Passing axe is not conformance.

## 5. Colour and contrast

Every token, ratio and colour rule is in [docs/STYLEGUIDE.md](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md).
The [contrast table](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#contrast) there is generated from the
CSS and `tests/contrast-table.spec.ts` fails when it drifts.

### Dark surfaces

- `text`, `subtle`, `gold`, `cyan` and `pink-text` clear 7:1 on `background`
  and `surface`.
- `border` carries every boundary and clears SC 1.4.11.
- `pink` is non-text only; `pink-text` carries every pink glyph.
- The focus ring clears every shadow it could touch
  ([Focus](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#focus)).

### The gold surface

A full or thin PageHero slab, the closing band on `/contact`, the kindness
quote on `/about` and any `Section surface="gold"` are `#FFC000`. Every dark
token fails on it, so `.surface-gold` swaps in a near-black set, links stay
underlined (SC 1.4.1) and the dark buttons are replaced by gold ones:
[Gold surface](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#gold-surface).

### The solid block

`.card-solid` is a `text` fill where only `background` passes, so everything
inside, the focus ring included, is `background` (`tests/solid-block.spec.ts`,
[Markup](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#markup)).

### Light mode

The header switch turns `<main>` light; the header and footer stay dark. Every
text colour clears 4.5:1 on white:
[Light mode](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#light-mode).

## 6. How it is tested

### Automated

Playwright runs the production build in Chromium and Firefox, and WebKit in
CI, on every pull request and every push to `main`. Any failure blocks the
merge.

Limits:

- Only rules in the WCAG A and AA tags and `best-practice` run. A green suite
  says nothing about AAA rules.
- A contrast rule measures a label against its own control, not the control
  against the ground: a control with no visible edge passes axe.
  `tests/gold-surface.spec.ts` checks fill or border against the ground.
- `overflow-wrap: break-word` hides a heading floor that is too large: the
  heading breaks mid-word instead of overflowing. The heading word fit check
  covers this.
- `tests/forced-colors.spec.ts` skips all but one test on WebKit, which
  reports `forced-colors: active` and paints the author palette anyway. The
  remaining test fails if that changes in any engine.
- Headless WebKit is not Safari and says nothing about VoiceOver.

### Manual

[docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) is the checklist. Run and
passed: from §9, the mobile menu button, footer profile tiles and mobile menu
links. Not automated:

- Whether the focus order makes sense and the ring is easy to find.
- Screen reader announcements, including how CSS-uppercased names are read
  (Chromium exposes `"ABOUT"` for markup `About`).
- Reduced motion, 400% zoom and text-only zoom, by hand.
- Firefox and Safari, by hand.
- Plain language, cognitive load and reading order.

## 7. Known gaps

1. **The contact form's error path is untested by a person.** Asserted over
   HTTP: labels, a 422 keeping typed values, `aria-invalid`, summary links,
   "(required)" in each label, honeypot, rate limit. Asserted in the browser:
   `aria-disabled` and "Sending" on the button, the status text, no busy
   ancestor, no second submit. In markup only: `novalidate`, the summary's
   `tabindex="-1" autofocus` (no `role="alert"`, to avoid a double read),
   `aria-describedby` on a failing field, the inset pink error ring, and the
   back-forward cache reset. `/contact/send/` is outside `tests/routes.ts`, so
   no route-level suite renders the error state and nothing checks focus lands
   on the summary. Nobody has judged whether the messages help (SC 3.3.1,
   3.3.3) or heard them with a screen reader. SC 3.3.7 and 3.3.8 do not apply.
2. **No screen reader testing.** No NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver or Orca run.
   [MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) §6 is an Orca pass in Firefox,
   with §6.4 in Chrome for the uppercase question. An Orca pass narrows this
   gap; it does not close it.
3. **The gold surface has been measured, not looked at.**
   `tests/gold-surface.spec.ts` measures the `/contact` band at 305px:

   | Measured on `/contact`          | Result                                       |
   | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
   | `.btn-gold-primary`             | its fill delimits it on gold                 |
   | its focus ring                  | inner `#FFFFFF` ring, 18.58 against the fill |
   | every string on the gold ground | nothing below 4.5:1                          |

   `.btn-gold-secondary` (on `/` and `/career`) is measured by its border edge
   on gold, in the same spec.
   Nobody has tabbed, zoomed or listened to a gold band.
   [MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) §5 closes this.

4. **Fixture and in-situ gold tests cover different mistakes.** Fixtures can be
   broken on purpose; only the in-situ test catches a mistake in a shipped
   route. Both stay.
5. **Prose has not been judged.** Reading order, heading usefulness and link
   text out of context have not been assessed by a person on any page.
6. **The talk PDF has not been read with a screen reader.**
   `public/talks/open-source-is-not-just-code.pdf` passes PDF/UA-1 in
   `npm run check:pdf`: tagged, English, a bookmark and heading per slide, alt
   text on both images, a description on every link.
   `tests/talk-pdf.spec.ts` fails when `slides.md` changes without a reprint.
   Reading order across cards, how capitalised slide labels are spoken, and
   whether viewers expose the structure are unchecked
   ([MANUAL_TESTING.md](docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md) §13). The HTML slideshow at
   `/talks/open-source-is-not-just-code/` passes the route suites; nobody has
   heard it (§13.5), and no person has compared it slide for slide with the
   original deck. Carried in text: slide 14's
   screenshot, slide 26's pairs (as a table), the pillar and topic groupings.
   Left off: the four Lord of the Rings images with their captions and
   credits, and the labels above 27 slide titles that restate them.

## 8. Reporting a barrier

If something on this site blocks you, report it. You do not need to know the
WCAG criterion or say anything about yourself.

- **Public:** <https://github.com/sindurigf/sinduri-lol/issues>
- **Private:** <lol@sinduri.lol>

Useful, never required: the page, what you tried and what happened, your
browser, operating system and assistive technology, a screenshot.

| Severity | Meaning                                                  | Priority                 |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Blocker  | You cannot complete a task (read, navigate, send a form) | Above everything else    |
| Serious  | You can complete it only with a workaround or with help  | Next, before new work    |
| Moderate | It works but is confusing, slow or tiring                | Scheduled with new work  |
| Minor    | Cosmetic or best practice; nothing is blocked            | When the area is touched |

## 9. Contributor checklist

Rules this repository follows. Values and reasons:
[docs/STYLEGUIDE.md](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md).

- **Contrast.** Measure a new colour on every ground it can meet
  ([Adding a colour](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#adding-a-colour)). Never `pink` on
  text; never `pink-text` on non-text.
- **Gold.** Build gold grounds with `.surface-gold` only. Never the dark
  tokens, `.btn-primary` or `.btn-secondary` on gold.
- **Focus.** Never remove an outline. A focusable element that casts a shadow
  sets `lift-control` or `lift-object`. A new ground gets its ring measured
  against the ground and the element's edge. Never `outline-offset: 0`.
- **Keyboard.** Check tab order in both directions: Shift+Tab is the direction
  that goes under the sticky header.
- **Targets.** 24x24px on the target's own box. Never rely on spacing.
- **Motion.** [STYLEGUIDE Motion](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md#motion).
- **Semantics.** Native elements first: `<button>`, `<dialog>`, `<details>`.
  One `h1`, no skipped level. Name a `<section>` only with its visible
  heading. No "navigation" in a nav label.
- **Case.** Write sentence case and uppercase with CSS.
- **Images.** Alt describes the content, never the type or filename; `alt=""`
  when decorative. Never text over a photograph; the axe scans fail it. Photos
  sit in an `.aspect-frame`.
- **Links.** Underlined in running text. Link text makes sense on its own.
  Current page: `aria-current` plus a shape change, never colour alone.
- **SVG.** Decorative SVG is `aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"`.
- **ARIA.** Only where no native element works, with a comment saying why.
  No `aria-label` over visible text, except one that repeats it exactly: the
  logo link, where a `<wbr>` splits Chromium's computed name. A toggle with
  `aria-expanded` or `aria-pressed` keeps a constant name; the hero's transport
  control is named for its action, "Pause the hero animation" or "Play the
  hero animation".
- **Forms.** Visible labels with "(required)" in words, `autocomplete` on
  personal fields, `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` on errors, a focused
  error summary. `aria-disabled`, never `disabled`, on buttons.
- **Forced colours.** A control bounded only by a shadow has no edge in forced
  colours: give it a border or an opaque fill.
- **Reflow.** Never add horizontal padding to a page container. A display
  heading word over twelve characters takes a soft hyphen.
- **This file.** Update it in the same commit as the change. A gap is removed
  when it has been tested, not when it was fixed in passing.

## 10. Criteria that do not apply

| Criterion                       | Why                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1.2.x Time-based media          | No video or audio is published          |
| 2.5.7 Dragging Movements        | Nothing drags                           |
| 3.2.6 Consistent Help           | No help mechanism; the form is one step |
| 3.3.7 Redundant Entry           | Nothing is asked twice                  |
| 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication | No authentication                       |
